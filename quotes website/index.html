                <h3>
                    <ol>Hazrat Ali Wisdom and Knowledge</ol>
                </h3>
                <li> The biggest shame is to mock at something that you have in yourself

                    Imam Ali (AS)</li>
                <li>Two things define you: Your patience when you have nothing and your attitude when you have
                    everything.</li>
                <li> People act like mirrors; friends reflect your good qualities and enemies your faults.</li>
                <li>Through patience, great things are accomplished.</li>
                <li>Incapability is a catastrophe; endurance is bravery; abstinence is riches; self-restraint is a
                    shield (against sin); and the best companion is submission (to Allah’s will)

                    Hazrat Ali</li>
                <li>Miserliness is shame; cowardice is a defect; poverty disables an intelligent man from arguing his
                    case; and a destitute person is a stranger in his home town.</li>
                <li> Knowledge is a venerable estate; good manners are new dresses; and thinking is clear mirror.</li>
                <li>The best of riches is the abandonement of desires.</li>
                <li>The worth of a man is according to his courage, his truthfulness is according to his balance of
                    temper, his valour is according to his self-respect and his chasteness is according to his sense of
                    shame.</li>
                <li>Victory is by determination; determination is by the turning over of thoughts; and thoughts are
                    formed by guarding secrets.</li>
                <li>Fear the attack of a noble person when he is hungry, and that of an ignoble person when he is
                    satiated.</li>
                <li>Fear the attack of a noble person when he is hungry, and that of an ignoble person when he is
                    satiated.</li>
                <li>The hearts of the people are like wild beasts. Whoever tames them, they would pounce upon him.</li>
                <li> The sin that displeases you is better in the view of Allah than the virtue which makes you proud.
                </li>
                <li>When you get (only) small favors do not push them away through lack of gratefulness.</li>
                <li>Whenever a person conceals a thing in his heart it manifests itself through unintentional words from
                    his tongue and (in) the expressions of his face.</li>
                <li>O my son, you should avoid making friends with a fool because he may intend to benefit you but may
                    harm you; you should avoid making friends with a miser because he will run away from you when you
                    need him most; you should avoid making friends with a sinful person because he will sell you for
                    nought; and you should avoid making friends with a liar because he is like a mirage, making you feel
                    far things near and near things far.</li>
                <li> He who gallops with loose rein collides with death.</li>
                <li> Generosity is that which is by one’s own initiative, because giving on being asked is either out of
                    self-respect or to avoid rebuke.

                    Imam Ali (AS)</li>
                <li>There is no wealth like wisdom, no destitution like ignorance, no inheritance like refinement and no
                    support like consultation.</li>
                <li>Keep walking in your sickness as long as you can (source).</li>
                <li>Fear! Fear! By Allah, He has hidden your sins so much so as though He has forgiven.</li>
                <li>The most capable of pardoning is he who is the most powerful to punish.</li>
                <li>Contentment is wealth that does not diminish</li>
                <li> Whoever warns you is like one who gives you good tidings.</li>
                <li>Whoever places himself as a leader of the people should commence with educating his own self before
                    educating others; and his teaching should be by his own conduct before teaching by the tongue.</li>
                <li>The person who teaches and instructs his own self is more entitled to esteem then he who teaches and
                    instructs others.</li>
                <li>As intelligence increases, speech decreases.</li>
                <li> If what you aim at does not come about then do not worry as to what you were.</li>
                <li>Time wears our bodies, renews desires, brings death nearer and takes away aspirations. Whoever is
                    successful with it encounters grief and whoever misses its favors also undergoes hardships.</li>
                <li>You will not find an ignorant person but at one extreme or the other (i.e. a person who neglects or
                    a person who exaggerates).</li>
                <li>With wealth a strange land is a homeland, while with destitution even a homeland is a strange land.
                </li>
                <li>Do not let your difficulties fill you with anxiety, after all it is only in the darkest nights that
                    stars shine more brightly.</li>
                <li>A man’s measure is his will.</li>
                <li>The tongue is a beast; if it is let loose, it devours.</li>
                <li>The people of the world are like travellers who are being carried while they are asleep.</li>
                <li>Be generous but not extravagant; be thrifty but not miserly.</li>
                <li>Do not feel ashamed for giving little because refusal is smaller than that.</li>
                <li>Nothing hurts a good soul and a kind heart more than to live amongst people who cannot understand
                    it.</li>
                <li>Woman is a scorpion whose sting is sweet.</li>
                <li> If you don’t know a thing never hesitate or feel ashamed to learn it.</li>
                <li>When the world pushes you to your knees, you’re in the perfect position to pray</li>
                <li> See the bad inside yourself, and see the good inside others</li>
                <li>Do not criticize too much. Too much criticism leads to hate and a bad behavior.</li>
                <li>Don’t hate what you don’t know, for the greater part of knowledge consists what you don’t know.

                    If you are met with a greeting, give better greetings in return. If a hand of help is extended to
                    you, do a better favour in return, although the credit would remain with the one who was first.</li>

                <li>Dislike in yourself what you dislike in others.</li>
                <li>Don’t follow majority follow the truth.</li>
                <li>A wise man always has something to say, whereas a fool always needs to say something.</li>
                <li>Courtesy costs nothing, but buys everything.</li>
                <li> Patience ensures victory. </li>
                <li>Backbiting is the attempt of one who is incapable of doing better himself.</li>
                <li>Patience is of two kinds, patience over what pains you, and patience against what you covet.</li>
                <li> When proven wrong, the wise corrects himself & ignorant argues.</li>
                <li>No Mirror can reflect a picture of a human as best as his attitude and way of Speaking do.</li>

            </ol>

            <li> Gone Are those who pile wealth, even while they are alive. But those who are knowledgeable stay as long
                as there is night & day: although their bodies may be dead, but their knowledge is alive in the heart .
            </li>


            <li>Charity is an effective cure, and the actions of people in their present life will be before their eyes
                in the next </li>
            <li> All matters are subject to destiny, so much so that sometimes death results from effort. </li>

            <li>A person’s true patience is shown in a time of anger </li>
            <li> Rendering relief to the grief-stricken and providing comfort in hardship are among the means of
                atonement for great sins.</li>


            <li> Don’t talk about your good health in front of sick. Don’t talk about your riches in front of poor.</li>

            <li>When you are running away from the world and death is approaching, there is no question of delay in the
                encounter.</li>
            <li> Our enemies are not Jews or Christians, but our enemies are our ignorance.</li>
            <li>The breath of a man is a step towards his death.</li>

            <li>He who trusts the world, the world betrays him.</li>

            <li>There is no rest for the person who has envy, and there is no love for the person who has bad manners.
            </li>
            <li> You are master of what you say until you utter it, once you deliver it, you are its captive. Preserve
                your tongue as you do your gold and money. One word could bring disgrace and the termination of a bliss.
            </li>
            <li> Don’t show pleasure in somebody’s downfall, for you have no knowledge of what the future holds in store
                for you.</li>
            <li> Aim to live in this world without allowing the world to live inside you because when a boat sits on
                water, it sails perfectly, but when water enters the boat, it sinks.</li>


            <li>The nourishment of body is food, while the nourishment of the soul is feeding oth</li>

                <h1>Hazrat Ali Friendship, Love and Marriage.</h1>
            </ol>

            <li> Woman is a delicate creature with strong emotions who has been created by the Almighty God to shoulder
                responsibility for educating society and moving toward perfection.</li>
            <li> God created woman as symbol of His
                own beauty and to give solace to her partner and her family</li>

            <li> A brother is like gold and a friend is like diamond. If gold cracks you can melt it and make it just
                like it was before. If a diamond cracks, it can never be like it was before. </li>
            <li> It is easier to turn a mountain into dust than to create love in a heart that filled with hatred.</li>
            <li> Keep in touch with the one who forgotten you, and forgive those who wronged you, and do not stop
                praying for the best for those who love you.</li>

                your back, and after your death,</li>

            <li> Meet people in such a manner that if you die they should weep for you and if you live they should long
                for you.</li>

            <li> The most helpless of all men is he who cannot find a few brothers during his life, but still more
                helpless. is he who finds such a brother but loses him..</li>

            <li> He who is abandoned by near ones is dear to remote ones.</li>

            <li> A lack of friends means strangeness.
            </li>
            <li> It’s never the value of water but thirst, it’s never the value of life but death and it’s
                never about the friendship but trust. </li>

                power to confiscate the powers of Qutub (rank of Auliyas). "Zinda" is an Urdu-Hindi term means "living",
                per the basic principle of Sufism that Sufi saints stay alive forever (death is the intermediate stage
                which they have to just pass). Makanpuri in his name, represents the town Makanpur (a town in India
                where this sufi saint is resting today).</p>
